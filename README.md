# Intrinsic fluid web design

 Based on the work by Jen Simmons and Utopia I try to build a website in pure CSS which is fully responsive, and without the need for any @-queries.

 I build upon the basic flexibility principle Jen explores on her website, by adding font and space calculations from Utopia.
